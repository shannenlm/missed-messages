# Missed Messages

A game built using Twine (Snowman 2.0.2) for ENGL378P at the University of Maryland.

## Overview 

This Twine game titled <i>Missed Messages</i> seeks to explore the concept of player agency in text-based games through choices and how that impacts the enjoyment players might find in the game.Â For example, <i><a href="https://tenderclaws.com/pry">Pry</a></i> has limited mappings/choices but was still very interesting, and some controls had to be figured out like the braille. On the other hand, <i><a href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/blackbar/id672002602">Blackbar</a></i> has a lot of freedom but is frustrating at times because of that. <i><a href="https://micharoja.itch.io/redshift-and-portalmetal">Redshift & Portalmetal</a></i> is a mix of both of those, providing lots of options, but some of them lead in circular paths. This led to the exploration of the world and story in that game to be enjoyable, but sometimes it got too convoluted. Though this game's story is linear, it offers different options to the player throughout to experiment with agency. 

In its exploration of player agency, <i>Missed Messages</i> tells the story of a girl who is afraid of facing the consequences of her decisions.
